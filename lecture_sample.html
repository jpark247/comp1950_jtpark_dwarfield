		<h1>LECTURE THREE: CSS TECHNIQUES</h1>
		<form action="#">
		<h2>Linking your CSS</h2>
		When linking to external style sheets, there are a number of things to know. A standard LINK element:<br>
		<div id="code">
			<pre><code>&lt;link	rel="stylesheet" 
	type="text/css" 
	href="http://www.mysite.com/css/styles.css" 
	title="Main Style" 
	media="screen" /&gt;</code></pre>
		</div>
	
	This features a number of things to keep in mind: 
	
	<ul>
    <li>Each stylesheet requires it's own link tag</li>
    <li>Multiple stylesheets can be loaded (main.css, fonts.css, layout.css, etc)</li>
    <li>The rel determines how the HTML will use the file linked to</li>
    <li>The type attribute is optional, potentially increasing browser backward compatibility</li>
    <li>href defines the path, relative or absolute, to the css file</li>
    <li>The title attribute allows the user to select different styles if required</li>
    <li>The media attribute allows you to specify what medium this should be viewed in</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Alternate sheets: rel</h2>
	You can also have alternate style sheets supported
	
	<ul>
    <li>rel="stylesheet" defines the default stylesheets to use</li>
    <li>rel="alternate stylesheet" allows different styles to be defined</li>
    <li>Tip: If you have multiple sheets that belong to one "look" make sure they all have the same title</li>
    <li>You can create alternate style sheets for users, allowing them to select which ones they would like to see</li>
    <li>An example would be to create a 'Larger Text' style sheet with everything in a larger font, or an alternate Halloween stylesheet for your site</li>
    <li>Many browsers are now giving users the ability to select which sheet they would like to see. (Firefox: View > Page Style)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<div id="alt">
		
	<div id="bold">ALTERNATE STYLESHEET EXERCISE</div>
    <a href="#" id="alt_css">Download the alternate stylesheet starting files</a><br>
    Make a copy of one of the current stylesheets, rename it, and change some of the styles<br>
    Add a third alternative stylesheet to this page<br>
    Show your instructor when complete<br>

	</div>
	
	<h2>Media variations: media</h2>
	
	<ul>
    <li>media="type" can be a powerful tool</li>
    <li>Examples of supported types: all, aural, braille, embossed, handheld, print, projection, screen, tty, tv</li>
    <li>Most are not commonly supported, but ones that you will see often: all, screen, print with handheld becoming more popular</li>
    <li>Almost all browsers use the print sheet to render text and elements for when the user selects a page to print</li>
    <li>This can be extremely valuable for when you have a lot of page information that you might not want to have show up on a printout (ie: navigation)</li>
    <li>Try a media detection exercise: <a href="#">Download css media example files</a>, test them after publishing online. Examine the code to see how they work.</li>
    <li>NOTE: you can simulate a variety of clients using Google's Chrome web browser:
        <ul>
		<li>Open the document in Chrome</li>
        <li>Choose Tools > Developer Tools</li>
        <li>Open the Emulate panel</li>
        <li>Choose the Screen option, then enable CSS Media</li>
        <li>Use this to emulate different source devices</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
    <li>Several handheld devices (iPhones, tablets, most Andriods) do not identify themselves as media type 'handheld'</li>
    <li>The reasoning was that the devices were more than capable of displaying standard web sites, so they identify as 'screen'</li>
    <li>In session #5, we will apply media queries for responsive design, allowing us to customize the presentation based on the various portable devices</li>
	</ul>
